Hi! My name's Jett. I love smiling, eating, coding, listening to indie music, playing video games, and living a healthy lifestyle. I also have a weakness for anything with matcha and cinammon.
While most programmers are more productive at night, I am quite the opposite. I can think crystal clear in the morning while slowly losing most of my sanity through the evening.

>Code Smart; not Hard.

I believe the world can be a better place if programmers practice good design and architecture while eating falafels.
