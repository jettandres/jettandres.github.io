Hello there! Welcome to my technical blog. I will be posting tutorials from my experiences in the world of coding and native mobile app development for both Android and iOS platforms.

One of my goals for this blog is to encourage an environment of continuous learning. So feel free to correct me for any misguided information or leave a comment for questions on a particular topic. Let us all become better programmers.

>Code Smart; not Hard.

## My Codeventure

I'm from the Philippines! I took up BS in Information Systems at De La Salle University - Manila (AY 2010-2014). While not mainly a computer science degree (60% IT, 40% Business), graduates from our class tend to be Software Engineers or Systems/Business Analyst in the real world. I chose to be a Mobile App Developer.

My first mobile app was a simple Taxi Fare Calculator for Windows Phone 7 Mango as a class final requirement way back in 2011. The development process exposed me to consuming SOAP and RESTful cloud services.

That would not have been possible if not for our school's partnership with Microsoft which provided its students free licenses for Microsoft's range of products like Visual Studio and MS SQL.

This privilege bestowed upon by Microsoft influenced the development of two of my major requirements in college - A Project Management Information System and an IT Service and Asset Lifecycle Management Information System. Both web apps used Microsoft's newest framework back then (now deprecated) called Silverlight.

I became very comfortable programming in C# after transitioning from Java, my introduction language to Object Oriented Programming.

In the summer of 2014 (Q1/Q2 in the Philippines), a friend and I accepted an impromptu hackathon invitation while hanging out inside a coffee shop. This changed my life as a programmer.

It's impromptu because it was the following day. While we competed unprepared with an app idea showcased in Windows Phone 7 Mango, we took home some prizes thereafter. The biggest one was our least expected - a funding from an NGO.

That event started my Android Development journey and lead me to where I am now.

It has been two years since then. While I may not claim to know everything about Android, iOS, and Mobile App development as a whole, I sure did learn a lot. Some of them I wish I knew sooner for college.
