In my [previous post](../vcs-why-should-i-use-one "Version Conrol System: Why Should I Use One?"), we talked about *Dark Souls* and its similarity with *Version Control System* or *VCS*. Today we are going to discuss about the difference between a *standard save* **(Ctrl + S or Command + S)** and the **VCS** *way of saving* with **Git**.

>Wait a minute, **what is Git**? I think I have heard about it before. And what is the **difference with GitHub?**

I got you. We will cover this later on. For now, all you need to know is that  _**Git** and **GitHub** are different like **Car** and **Carpet**._

Below is a screenshot from one of the games I play for leisure. The game is called **Stardew Valley**. *(Check it out on Steam if you miss playing __Harvest Moon__ or any similar farming simulator game)*

<<Insert 2 Screens here>>

Did you notice anything aside from my character's bearded hipster/sailor fashion and purple shoes? In the Main Menu, we have three buttons namely New, Load, and Exit. When I click on Load, we are presented with a list of characters that I have made in the past. These are my Save files.

Clicking the New button from the Main Menu would allow me to create and add another new character to the list.

Normally when we play video games, some games (like RPGs) would allow us to create multiple Save files for a single character. Unfortunately for Stardew Valley, the developer did not allow that. Instead, we are left with a single character per save that can be Overwritten by that same character as we progress through the game.

This perfectly demonstrates what I want to show you next.

Here we have a simple notepad.

<<Insert Simple Notepad here>>

We can type in anything we have in mind ~~including our feelings~~.

After typing our ~~feelings~~ thoughts and updating the file, we then hit our trusty old pal Ctrl + S or Command + S to Save it. On our first time of Saving, my computer will ask me where I want to save my file so that I can come back to it later on in case I would like update my ~~feelings~~ thoughts or simply view them.

<<Insert Save - A Simple Notepad>>

This is the standard way of Saving files.

>But what if I would like to update my ~~feelings~~ thoughts but keep the old one just in case I am not really sure with the new one?

We then rely to the Save As... button found under File menu.

<<Insert Save As - Simple Notepad Here>>

This will prompt us again like our first time and ask where we want to Save the old one.

<<Insert Save As - Simple Notepad - 2 Here>>

Perfect! Now we have two copies of the same file with different filenames to distinguish them. This process is called Software Versioning or Versioning for short. Derived from the word 'Version' a particular form of something differing in certain respects from an earlier form or other forms of the same type of thing. (Thanks Google Dictionary)

Versioning with Git also works this way but in a cleaner fashion. It will also allow us to take note of the changes and updates we have made to the old file better than describing/putting them in a file name.

Finally as demonstrated, Versioning is not just for programmers. It can also be for anyone working with text-based files with an exception on images. (I will explain more of this again later)

I will let this is sink in to you for now. In my next post, we shall get our hands dirty and get you started with setting up and embracing Git in your daily life. Thanks for reading!
