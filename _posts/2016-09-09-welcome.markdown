Hello there! Thank you for reading my first post.
I will be covering the following topics in the weeks to come in a series of post.

- **Version Control System (VCS)**
- **Design Patterns and Principles**
- **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) with RxJava**

I hope they get you excited as much as I do!
I will do my best to explain everything in layman's terms. Stay tuned!
