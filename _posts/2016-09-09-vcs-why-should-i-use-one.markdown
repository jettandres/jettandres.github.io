Have you ever played **Dark Souls** before? If not, here is a quick video to demonstrate how frustratingly difficult the game is.

Did you see how **_fragile_** your character is in the game? Apparently, the game has no difficulty and **_every hit you take could mean life or death_**.

Now imagine if the game completely removed the **save feature/checkpoints/bonfire**. Nobody could have beaten the game or improved his skills more effectively when combating  a specific boss or monster.

**Here is a simple analogy:**

- ## Your Code is your In-Game Character

	You level it up, equip it with various weapons and armor, and you keep its progress by saving overtime. This is your very identity and the one you take care of the most.

- ## The unexpected Bugs, Errors, and Crashes that would appear in your Code are the different Monsters in game.

	Some of them can be devastating when they hit you. Causing you to pull your hair out of frustration. Others are just a tickle or a speck to your health bar. You could despise them for the hell that they bring to your life but you got to admit your character would not level up, or gain new equipments and get stronger without them. So they are still part of the fun.

- ## And lastly, Version Control System is your in-game Checkpoint/Save Feature/Bonfire

	That's right. **Version Control System** or **VCS** is just a **_fancy name_** for a **_Save_** feature. It allows you to save your progress at a particular point in time and at a particular place.(We will explore on this later with **_Git Branching_** and **_Tagging_**)

Anyway, that is it for now in my introductory post about VCS. I hope you get a grasp by now of how important a save feature is.

In my next part of the series, we'll cover the difference between the *standard save* **(Ctrl + S or Command + S)** and the **VCS** *way of saving* files using **Git**. Thanks for reading!
