[Previously](../vcs-and-saving "Version Conrol System: Saving?"), we talked about Saving and Distributed VCS with Git. Today I will introduce you to a Repository.

>A **Repository** is like a USB Storage except that everytime we make a change inside our main folder like add a new file, delete an old one, or update the contents of an existing text file, Git monitors them. **Git** lives inside a Repository.

## There are two types of Repository:
- A **Local Repository** that is stored inside our computer
- A **Remote Repository** which is stored online either privately or publicly.

## Git and GitHub are different like Car and Carpet

**GitHub** is an example of an *online public repository*. It introduces the concept of *Open-Source* which means anyone at no cost can obtain, view, modify, and claim a copy of your code as their own.

>"But why is **Open-Source** such a big deal? Why would anyone want to share their code to the public?"

Plenty of significant reasons. Here are some of them.

## Reason #1: Community
The biggest reason why. You will never feel isolated and outdated when coding because you will get to see the trending libraries and frameworks under your programming language. Some of these can already be considered as essentials for a specific framework or language.

## Reason #2: Collaboration
You will have free Testers, QA and Developers from different backgrounds that can contribute to make your code more robust.

## Reason #3: Issue Tracking
Bugs and Hidden Errors can be spotted and resolved sooner since you enable people to try out your code. This is also perfect for beta testing.

## Reason #4: Growth
You can still enjoy the open-source community even if you are just lurking as an enthusiast since you will get to read more of other people's code which will give you a different perspective with regards to best practices in programming.

## Reason #5: Reputation
You can gain popularity as a developer or as a company with your contribution to the community. Pair this with a good StackOverflow profile and you will be racking job invitations from big companies as an individual.

Alternatively, you can still opt for a *Private Repository* like **Bitbucket** or **GitLab** if you are hosting sensitive data with your team. (i.e.for work) Some of the items I listed above would still apply albeit less maximized.

*That is it for now. I hope you enjoyed this post! In my next article, we will cover __why we'll use Git among other VCS__ before we get our hands dirty and dive into its technical details.*
