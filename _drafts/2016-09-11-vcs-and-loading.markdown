## Git and GitHub

I still owe you some explanation with regards to GitHub.

> **GitHub** is simply an online storage to save your files. In Version Control terms, we call this a _Repository_.
  It's like Dropbox / Google Drive but different because it complements some VCS's functionalities. Which VCS? You guessed it! **Git**.  

A **Repository** stores our saved code and makes it accessible anywhere we have an internet on via browser.

a Repository can either be **Public** or **Private** depending on the company that is
hosting the service.

 - **Public Repository** can be accessed by **_anyone_** and *gives full consent to anyone to
 make a copy of his own* for modification purposes. A copy can be stored in one's local computer (aka **_Cloning_**) or in his public repository (aka **_Forking_**).
